# `react-testing-library`
## or: How I Stopped Worrying and Learned To Love Integration Tests
### Show & Tell - May 2019

## Recap

React works by giving it a "description of the DOM" that we want to see in the 
"real DOM". We never* directly manipulate the DOM ourselves.

React then figures out the most efficient way to transform the real DOM into our
description

<small>(* this isn't quite true, but for our purposes let's imagine that it is)</small>

---

## React Testing Strategies

Because of this we could write tests that check this "description" (which is
just a JS object) to see if contains what we expect. We don't necessarily need
to apply the transformation to the DOM.

This is potentially useful, because now we can run frontend tests in Node,
without having to use a real browser

There's very popular library to do this: [Enyzme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/)

---

## What's the problem?

<div style={{ fontSize: '2.2rem' }}>
This "description", isn't the real DOM, it's actually a double (aka
mock/fake/stub).

Enzyme's API allows you to check the internal state/props of a component.

It allows you to "reach in" to find other child components.

These are all implementation details that the user doesn't care about. They
don't care that a component named `PublishModal` is rendered. They don't care
about the internal state.

They care that they can see journals and can click on publish buttons.

<div style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem' }}>

The author of `react-testing-library` (Kent C. Dodds) makes these points in [this blog post](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/why-i-never-use-shallow-rendering)
about why it doesn't use shallow rendering.

## `react-testing-library`

RTL is a utility library that encourages good testing practices. It doesn't use
shallow rendering but instead makes rendering real DOM nodes easier.

The [guiding principles](https://testing-library.com/docs/guiding-principles)
state that using a DOM node is better than component instances.

<div style={{ fontSize: '1.4rem' }}>
Note: the recommended way in the docs is to use JSDOM (an "fake" implementation
of the DOM in Node). But we have a real browser available to us because we use,
which runs the tests in headless Chrome.

```jsx
import { render, fireEvent, waitForElement } from 'react-testing-library'
import EmisExport from 'Modules/publish-modal/public/es/src/components/emis_export'

it('sends data when starting export', async () => {
  const { getByText } = render(<EmisExport />)

  const submitButton = getByText(/submit to myjournal/i)
  fireEvent.click(submitButton)

  await waitForElement(() => getByText(/export successful/i))

  expect(getByText(/export failed/i)).to.not.exist
})
```

---

## Write tests "the way the user would use it"

The user does not care how the code is implemented. They only care that they can
click a button and then they see a message.

[The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you.](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106)

This was the biggest hurdle to me: I'm not used to thinking from the users
perspective when writing tests.

---

Because of this principle, the react-testing-library API forces you to operate
the application via relatively limited "queries". These queries (e.g.
`getByText()`) can only be used like a user would think about using the
application.

So you can't get an element by it's CSS selector. Users don't think about
getting elements by CSS selectors. That is an implementation detail.

---

This also forces us to think about accessibility

```jsx
const Textbox = () => {
  return <input type="text" id="textbox" />
}

it('renders', () => {
  const { getByLabelText } = render(<Textbox />)

  // This fails: because we don't have a label for our textbox
  // We can fix by adding <label for="textbox">Some label text</label> to our component
  expect(getByLabelText(/some label text/i)).to.exist
})
```

All tests must be driven through user-perceivable elements.

---

Our tests are really integration tests: they test more than a single unit.

Instead they test how a unit works in context.

Previously I would have said this was generally bad - the majority of
our tests should be unit tests not integration tests.

---

Kent C. Dodds argues that the "test pyramid" should instead be a
["test trophy"](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests):

Unit tests are cheap to create, but you need a lot of them to be confident in
your code.

End-to-end tests give you the greatest confidence that your implementation is
correct. But they are costly to create and prone to flakiness.

---

Integration tests hit the sweet spot of not being too costly to create without
but give reasonable confidence that your application will work well for users.

All three types are still required, but focusing on having the most integration
tests is the most "efficient".

---

## Things to keep an eye on

RTL is still very new, I'm still not 100% convinced.

- Is `waitForElement()` flaky?
- Can the query API sometimes give you false positives - getting elements
elsewhere in the DOM that you didn't intend?
